## Description
Tutorial for cleaning, analyzing, and displaying insights from the Chicago Food Inspection dataset.

Initial work in jupyter notebook as an ipython notebook

## Technologies used
  * jupyter
  * Google Colabratory
  * python
  * pandas
  * pareto


## Clean Data
Original dataset we used is from the Chicago Data Portal and can be found here:
[Food Inspections](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5/data)

### Violations
  * First step is to pull out unique list of violations and count their occurrences
  * Visualize violations using pareto chart

## Statistical Analysis
 * Figure out who is using different processes
 * Scatter plots
 * how long since last inspection?
 * location
 * how often are violations associated with each other?
 * optimize flow of inspection

## Neural network
 * predict who is going to fail and why
 * might need to pull in weather data (i.e fridge is too warm)
