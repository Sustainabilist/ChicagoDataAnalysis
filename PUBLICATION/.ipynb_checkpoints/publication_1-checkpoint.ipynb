    "# Revisiting Food-Safety Inspections from the Chicago Dataset - A Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Foodborne illnesses afflict an estimated 48 million Americans each year, resulting in 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 fatalities [1]. City Governments curb the spread of illness by enforcing stringent standards for food preparation but often act under heavy resource constraints. Building on work by the Chicago Department of Public Health, this tutorial seeks to explore a predictive model of food code violations that could provide real-time risk analysis both to public officials and the facilities they inspect. (needs streamlining)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. Past Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2014 the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) and other local agencies worked to develop a model that would forecast critical violations, allowing the CDPH to prioritize inspections of facilities expected to be in violation of health codes [2] [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "After exploring a number of datasets and features, the team found the strongest predictors of critical violations to be the inspector assigned, previous inspection outcomes, age at inspection, licenses for alcohol or tobacco, the temperature at time of inspection, nearby burglaries, nearby sanitation complaints and nearby garbage cart requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a glmnet model trained on data from January 2011 through January 2014, the team was able to demonstrate a data-driven inspections schedule that significantly reduced the time to find a critical violation. This model has since been adopted by the CDPH.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2. Premise\n",
    "\n",
    "In light of the CDPH's success, we began this project intending to explore and extend their work. Whereas the Chicago team set out to predict critical violations, we are working to develop a series of models to forecast individual violations and to explore neural networks for the prediction model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By developing a higher resolution model we hope to provide actionable information not just to public officials but to restaurants themselves. In addition to being generally interested in customers' health, restaurants are fined $500 for each critical and $250 for each serious violation found,and so are highly motivated to maintain health codes. A real-time violation risk analysis could thus provide actionable info to restaurants on an ongoing basis, improving inspection outcomes and safeguarding public health.\n",
    "\n",
    "[COULD PUT SOME OF THE COST ESTIMATE, AVERAGE INSPECTIONS AND FAILS WORK HERE]\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Pre-processing and Data Structuring\n",
    "\n",
    "While we may involve additional datasets as work progresses we decided to start by preparing those datasets that the Chicago team found to be significant, translating from R to Python and adapting to suit our purposes as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets used are as follows:\n",
    "* [food inspections](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Food-Inspections/4ijn-s7e5/data)\n",
    "* [business licenses](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/Business-Licenses/r5kz-chrr/data)\n",
    "* [garbage cart requests](https://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/dataset/garbage_cart_stolenormissing.html)\n",
    "* [sanitation code complaints](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Service-Requests/311-Service-Requests-Sanitation-Code-Complaints/me59-5fac/data)\n",
    "* [crimes](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2018/3i3m-jwuy/data)\n",
    "* [weather](https://darksky.net/dev)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception of weather data from darksky.net, all data used is available through the [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/). We will not be working with data on inspector assigned, as this is not publicly available and would not be provide useful inisght in practice.\n",
    "\n",
